# Data-Science-Smartphone-Usage-Profiling
In today's digital age, smartphone addiction, particularly to social media and various apps, is a prevalent issue. This project aims to leverage data science and decision-making techniques to analyze detailed phone usage statistics and create a user profile based on their phone usage patterns. The provided datasets offer a comprehensive view of phone interactions, which will be analyzed and modeled to achieve this objective.

The first step involves combining the three provided CSV files into a single cohesive dataset. This process includes generating new features from the existing data to better understand user behavior. Once the dataset is created, the next phase is data preprocessing and cleaning, utilizing Python as the primary tool. Various techniques will be applied to ensure the data quality and readiness for analysis.

Following data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA) will be conducted to uncover insights and patterns within the dataset. Key statistics will be visualized to inform subsequent analysis steps. The data will then be prepared for machine learning by selecting, removing, or creating features as necessary, ensuring it is structured appropriately for model training and evaluation.

The dataset will be divided into training and testing sets using either hard separation or cross-validation techniques. Machine learning models will be implemented in Python to learn from the dataset, experimenting with various algorithms and fine-tuning parameters to optimize performance. The models will be evaluated using performance metrics, and adjustments will be made to model parameters or alternative models will be explored to improve results.

Finally, the project will investigate the applicability of decision-making techniques such as mathematical optimization or game theory to enhance the profiling process. The problem will be modeled and solved using these techniques, with guidance from the course instructor if needed. This comprehensive approach aims to provide a robust solution for profiling users based on their smartphone usage patterns.
